# Digital-twin: OSM editor for accessible indoor maps
This project started as a semestral work in the CTU FEL OI program. 
The main idea â€” create a user-friendly editor for indoor geodata to simplify the process of digitalization of spaces for navigation for visually impaired people and to create tools for further work on the development of specific navigation solutions.
